Features


Payments and Money Transfers

Perhaps the most well-known blockchain application is being able to send and receive payments. Since blockchain technology has it’s beginnings in cryptocurrency, this makes sense. But, how exactly is this beneficial for small business owners.

By using blockchain technology, you’re able to transfer funds directly and securely to anyone you want in the world almost instantly and at ultra-low fees. That’s because there aren’t any intermediaries slowing down the transfer of funds between several banks and charging outrageous transaction fees.




Smart Contracts

Decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.”

In a nutshell “it is a financial security held in escrow by a network that is routed to recipients based on future events, and computer code.” With “smart contracts” businesses will be able to bypass regulations and “lower the costs for a subset of our most common financial transactions.” Additionally, these contracts could be unbreakable.




Notary

Blockchain technology can also be used as a convenient and inexpensive notary service.



Digital Identigy

Did you know that fraud is estimated to cost the industry around $18.5 billion annually? In other words, that means that for every $3 spent, $1 is going to ad fraud. Because of that, security is a top concern for businesses of all sizes.

Blockchain technologies make tracking and managing digital identities both secure and efficient, resulting in seamless sign-on and reduced fraud.



Consultansy

There are many business opportunities that are stored within cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology itself that companies could easily benefit from. However, many companies stay oblivious to it, and so we may help those willing to find out for a small fee.

FAQ



What is versus coin?

Versus is the operating unit of the verusus platform. This is cryptocurency based on skein algorithm, POW&POS oriented. The anonymity will be guaranteed by masternodes and ZeroCash technology.


Why Versus?

Versus, often abbreviated v., v, vs., vs, or vrs. is a latin word meaning 'against'. Our idea to introduce the blockchain into the business stands against the traditional ways of managing it, that's why - Versus!


Who is behind the project?

Behind the project is a group of enthusiasts, long-standing people in the crypto-environment. Their names and their exact engagement with the project will be seen at the launch of the platform.


What makes Versus different from other projects?

The start of the coin with nothing. It will not be different from the start of any other coin, except perhaps that it will be smooth, transparent and secured with a good team. The launch of the entire platform that will soon follow the coin will be something different, something interesting and mysterious, something you will want to be a part of.


Will we see Versus in a certain trading platform?

Yes, Versus will be traded on more than one platform, allowing it to be added in Coinmarketcap.


How can I get Versus?

You can get Versus by mining initially, then by buying it from other users or exchange. In some time when POS starts you can get reward if you keep the coins in your personal wallet.


Aren’t early adopters getting more out of Versus than others?

The early investors take some risk and spend time and hashing power to this new platform that isn’t yet verified and could have flopped like so many others have in the past. So, yes, they'll get their reward.


Isn’t Versus just another scam scheme?

Versus will be an open source and free project without a central authority. The entire system is runing and will be controlled by its users. So there is no reason to think of a scam!


Why did you choose POS?

POS mining has some advantages than POW, no need of buying expensive hardware for mining, no need to pay for electricity and no need of setting the environment: electrical networks, cooling systems, air conditioning systems...and finally we would like to encourage people to keep their coins at least until the launch of the platform.


What is a Masternode?

Masternode is a full node running the client and providing extra services to the network as instant and anonymous transactions, decentralized governance and voting systems.


Why did you choose a skein algorithm?

Our analyzes show that this algorithm is gaining popularity lately. Even the fact that there are already asics for it but they are not much more effective than mining rigs is in his favor. Another great advantage is that it can be successfully mined by older video cards with a small amount of memory.


Tell us more about the platform to come out.

Тhe platform will be free to use for everyone. There will be some features and applications for business use protected by copyright and a small one-time payment will be required to unlock them. We will not share much details yet, but one of the subapplications will be proof of digital identity.
